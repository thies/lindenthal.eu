Dr Lindenthal is a Senior University Lecturer (Associate Professor) for Real Estate Finance. His research interests are twofold: First, he analyzes property investments in the very long-term, tracking rents, prices, and returns for up to 500 years. The second research line focuses on applied machine learning techniques to utilize high-dimensional “Big(ish)” data. Put differently, he uses images and other data that are too complex for spreadsheets to better understand property values, household preferences, and decisions made by very human and not always rational agents.

Thies takes pride in teaching and in Cambridge’s postgraduate program in Real Estate Finance, for which he is the course director. He is also a fellow at Murray Edwards College and at the Cambridge Endowment for Research in Finance. Before joining the University of Cambridge, he did a postdoc at MIT's Center for Real Estate, working on the market for virtual locations such as Internet domain names. His PhD is from Maastricht University.

Thies is a board member for the American Real Estate And Urban Economics (AREUA) association. In addition, he received a JM Keynes Fellowship in Financial Economics.

In response to the Covid lockdown, Thies co-organised a virtual research seminar series [Seminar.RE](https://www.seminar.re).

Thies is interested in supervising new PhD students in Real Estate Finance, preferably with a focus on new (somewhat "big") data or, alternatively, property markets in the very long run. However, candidates might have a look at [this debate](https://twitter.com/random_walker/status/1348664433216802817) first ...

Dr Lindenthal has served as an expert witness for internet domain names at US courts.
