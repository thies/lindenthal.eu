## Symposium

The University of Cambridge (Department of Land Economy), the University of Florida (Bergstrom Real Estate Center), the University of Hong Kong announce a call for papers for their joint 2025 Real Estate Finance and Investment Symposium. The symposium will feature longer, more in-depth paper presentations and will allow ample time for discussion among presenters, assigned discussants, and other participants. The event will be held in a relaxed yet focused setting aiming to inspire a critical mass of leading academics in the field to create new thoughts and insights on general finance, real estate finance, and investments topics.

The symposium will be hosted by the University of Florida’s Bergstrom Real Estate Center. Hotel accommodation (two nights for researchers from the U.S., three nights for those from overseas) and group meals will be provided by the organizing institutions. All travel costs will be borne by the participants.  The organizers do not wish to necessarily limit the focus of the conference, and papers on any real estate-related finance or economics topic are welcome. However, subject to sufficient interest, we may try to focus the symposium on one or more of the following themes:

* Real estate risk management
* Leverage, capital structure and real estate
* Infrastructure investment and privatization
* Real estate price index methodology and performance measurement
* Economics of sustainability in real estate
* International real estate investment
* “Big Data,” ML and AI in real estate finance research
* Behavioral approaches to real estate
* Debt and equity funds
* Real estate and decentralised finance

## PAPER SUBMISSION

The deadline for submission of papers is June 1st, 2025. From the submissions, the organizers will select approximately eight-nine papers for presentation at the symposium, with notification to authors by June 21st, 2025.
Authors should submit their papers electronically to:

* Changcheng Song, Rick Scarola Associate Professor of Finance, University of Florida,
* E-mail: Changcheng.song@warrington.ufl.edu
