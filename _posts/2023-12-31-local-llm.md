Would you like to run a large language model (LLM) on your own computer? [llamafile](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile) makes hosting a LLM chatbot locally as simple as downloading a single file and starting it. That's all. It took me less than a minute to arrive at my first home-spun text.

If you don't want your prompts and other data to be shared with Big Tech, or want to integrate a chatbot into a system that you control fully, or simply prefer open-source solutions (it's a Mozilla initiative!), then llamafile is worth a try.

I have been using LLMs a lot for teaching this year. Classroom discussions in which students were challenged to critique chatbot generated content was fun (I believe) and helped to focus on the key arguments and to ignore the smooth-sounding fluff. I am happy to generate the required discussion fodder with ChatGPT-4 or similar online.

My main use for LLM these days is more basic: Automaticly check spelling and grammar in my emails and other work. These checks got so much better when LLMs arrived and I rely on them heavily. However, I don't want every text to go through more computers than needed while drafting. That's why I am keen to find a local solution that is as good as the leading online services.

How good are the results? llamafile can let you run a number of models. I am still trying to see which works best for me. The default [LLaVA](https://llava-vl.github.io/) is trained on less data than ChatGPT-4, but it's performance is not too far off, allegedly.

Local spell checks with LLaVA are very useful. But the model runs very slowly, even on my strong laptop. Putting a llamafile chatbot onto a Raspberry Pi is out of reach, I suppose. Also, it's not well-integrated into my workflow, yet (manual copy and paste, for now).

Not sure I will need this feature much, but my new AI helper can analyse photos, too.

*User:* Describe the image and tell me if the person is happy.

*Llama:* The image features a man wearing a blue jacket, standing in front of a wooden wall and pointing his finger upwards. He appears to be gesturing towards the ceiling or an object above him. In addition to this main figure, there are two other people present in the scene; one is located on the left side near the bottom edge while another person can be seen further back at about half of the image's height. The man pointing seems focused and engaged with his surroundings.

*User:* Is he happy?

*Llama:* Yes, the man appears to be happy while pointing his finger at something.

The ultimate test, of course, is to blurb out an inspirational post for your LinkedIn profile.
