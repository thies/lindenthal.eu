My great-grandfather August Potuczek was an admirer of the etchings by <a href='https://www.biographien.ac.at/oebl/oebl_R/Rektorzik_Franz-X_1793_1851.xml'>Franz Xaver Rektorzik (1793â€“1853)</a>. In the 1920/30's, he made prints from Rektorzik's original plates, some of which I was able to find online. Today, they arrived in the mail. And now I am looking at the fine details, the branches, the leaves, and I can see, I think, why August Potuczek was fascinated by them. 
See for yourselves (better quality scans to follow at some point).
