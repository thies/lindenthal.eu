Land value surfaces estimated with a neural net. The implementation was surprisingly straightforward and results don't look completely insane. For instance, the surfaces are not as smooth as kriging (good!) but I have no idea how reliable the ML estimates really are. More work needed. Definitely not ready but exciting to see both the spatial distributions and the temporal dynamics.
