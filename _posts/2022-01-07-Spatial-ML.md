I dabbed a little into land value surfaces estimations using ML/neural nets. The implementation was surprisingly straightforward and results don't look completely insane. For instance, the surfaces are not as smooth as kriging (good!) but I have no idea how reliable the ML estimates really are. More work is needed, for sure, but it is exciting to already see the spatial and the temporal dynamics.
