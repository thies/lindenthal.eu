I’m not sure if anyone has used this term before, but if not, I would like to suggest “ultra-processed data.”

Think ultra-processed food: once-tasty ingredients get pulverized, refined, recombined, and flavoured until they look like food but have lost most of nutritious value.

Now replace food with data: LLMs trained on the outputs of other LLMs. Economic models trained on other models’ estimates. It looks like information, but it’s just intellectual junk food.
