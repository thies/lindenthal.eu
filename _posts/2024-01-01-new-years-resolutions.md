Still looking for an easy new year's resolution? Something that won't be difficult to do but might make a little difference every time you navigate the Internet?

It's easy: [Install Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/browsers/). On your laptop. On your phone.

Better privacy, less snooping or monetisation of your data by Google, Apple or Microsoft.

Faster browsing. No downside. Happy 2024!
