excerpt: "It happens so often, stings every time, and should not slow you down..."

I cannot say  I enjoyed this essay, but I recognised the turmoil of emotions following another rejection email: [‘Stay true to yourself – and fly closer to the sun’: what I’ve learned from 50 years of rejection](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/oct/08/stay-true-to-yourself-fly-closer-sun-what-ive-learned-from-50-years-of-rejection) by Bob Brody. 

I have not reached Bob's enlightened state of mind, yet. But I hope I will, eventually. Rejections sting.
