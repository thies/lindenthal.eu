excerpt: "This Wednesday (March 20) will be busy: First, I'll head to the University of Reading for a research seminar (12–1 pm). My paper shows how REIT return predictability increases when machine learning methods are allowed to shine. In the evening (6:15—7:15 pm), I will take part in a seminar on generative AI organised by the Society of Property Researchers in London. Pretty excited to share my work and to meet new and old friends."
