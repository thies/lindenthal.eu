When I was an undergraduate student, the Geltner/Miller/Eichholtz book was probably the textbook that changed my education the most... and the people behind it even more: Piet become my MPhil and PhD supervisor at Maastricht University, David was the key scholar and mentor during my postdoc at MIT and Norm guided my way into the Homer Hoyt community and taught me so much. Now, more than a decade after the latest update, the 4th edition of the book is finally in production, featuring my name among the authors.

We streamlined the book: The first part (printed) gives a foundation in real estate finance, whereas the the second part allows for customisation with more specialised topics. This will hopefully be closer to the reality of how instructors have used the book in their courses -- at least this is how I teach here in Cambridge. Importantly, the new structure also brought the price down: With current discounts, it will cost £59, which is less than what I paid 20 years ago (even in nominal terms!).
