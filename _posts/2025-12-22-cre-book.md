The Geltner/Miller/Eichholtz book was probably the textbook that taught me the most... and the people behind it even more: Piet became my MPhil and PhD supervisor at Maastricht University, David was the key scholar and mentor during my postdoc at MIT and Norm guided my way into the Homer Hoyt Institute and ARES community. Now, more than a decade after the last update, the 4th edition of the book is finally in production, featuring my name among the authors (humblebrag).

We updated and streamlined the book: The first part (printed) gives a foundation in real estate finance that should nicely fit into a semester/term. The second part (online) allows for customisation with more specialised topics. This structure will hopefully be closer to the reality of how instructors have used the book in their courses -- at least this is how I teach here in Cambridge. Importantly, the new format also brought the price down: With current discounts, it will cost £59 in the UK, which is less than what I paid 20 years ago (even in nominal terms!).
