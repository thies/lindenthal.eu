excerpt: "David Graeber’s 'On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs: A Work Rant' made a compelling argument: many modern jobs exist for no real reason. Bureaucratic middlemen, redundant administrators, corporate paper-pushers—roles that persist not because they add value, but because organizations (and the people in them) are too invested in keeping up appearances. I'd argue there are many buildings of similar qualities, too."

David Graeber’s <a href="https://strikemag.org/bullshit-jobs/">"On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs: A Work Rant"</a> made a compelling argument: many modern jobs exist for no real reason. Bureaucratic middlemen, redundant administrators, corporate paper-pushers—roles that persist not because they add value, but because organizations (and the people in them) are too invested in keeping up appearances. 

The good thing about a rant is that it does not need to be balanced or carefully tested and true in every little aspect. It is meant to provoke a discussion and make people question the status quo. For me, the logical follow up question is: Bullshit jobs don’t just take up time; they take up space. Entire office buildings exist to house these roles—spaces that, much like the jobs themselves, shouldn’t really be there anymore. 

I'd argue there are bullshit buildings in their own right. They are in wrong location, have obsolete characteristics, are too old, too dirty, and simply too drab and sad. What about all those office buildings that don't make any sense today? They are only there because they might seem a good idea to someone at some point in the past. Some of them house bullshit jobs (and are therefore not really adding value to society). But others are simply  Entire office buildings exist to house these roles—spaces that, much like the jobs themselves, shouldn’t really be there anymore. The wrong location, the wrong characteristics, too old, too dirty, too sad.

AI is now poised to challenge both. It’s coming for the repetitive, process-driven, and symbolic work that fuels much of modern bureaucracy. And if bullshit jobs start disappearing, what happens to the office towers that housed them?

Look around: many office properties you will see are already obsolete. The pandemic made that brutally clear, leaving millions of square feet underutilized, unloved, and unnecessary. Hybrid work showed that people don’t need to commute to uninspiring desks in uninspiring buildings to do uninspiring work. And now, AI is accelerating the shift—automating tasks, streamlining workflows, and exposing just how much of corporate life is performative.

The result? A reckoning for office real estate. Many properties won’t find a new purpose because they simply don’t deserve one. They were built for a world that no longer exists, for work that no longer needs to be done. Some will be repurposed, some will be torn down, and some will just sit, half-empty, relics of an era that clung to jobs—and spaces—no one really needed.

AI will not kill the office entirely—the good ones continue to make sense—but it will help expose the ones that were never worth keeping in the first place.
